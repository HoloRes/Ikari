     * ### About permission schemes and grants ###
     *
     * A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.
     *
     * #### Holder object ####
     *
     * The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:
     *
     *  *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
     *  *  `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
     *
     * The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):
     *
     *  *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
     *  *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
     *  *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
     *  *  `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
     *  *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
     *  *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
     *  *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
     *  *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
     *  *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
     *  *  `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used).
     *  *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
     *
     * #### Built-in permissions ####
     *
     * The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.

     * ### About project roles ###
     *
     * [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).
     *
     * Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.
     *
     * #### Members and actors ####
     *
     * In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.
     *
     * Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:
     *
     *  *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
     *  *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

   * The following context variables are available to Jira expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.
   *
   *  *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
   *  *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
   *  *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.

Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

   *
   * For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group *accounting* would be returned.

   *     If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.

   *
   * ### About notification schemes ###
   *
   * A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:
   *
   *  *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
   *  *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
   *
   *      *  `CurrentAssignee`
   *      *  `Reporter`
   *      *  `CurrentUser`
   *      *  `ProjectLead`
   *      *  `ComponentLead`
   *      *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
   *      *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
   *      *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
   *      *  `EmailAddress`
   *      *  `AllWatchers`
   *      *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
   *      *  `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
   *
   * *Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses.*
   *
   * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however the user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.

	/**
   * Returns all permission schemes.
   *
   * ### About permission schemes and grants ###
   *
   * A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.
   *
   * #### Holder object ####
   *
   * The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:
   *
   *  *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
   *  *  `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
   *
   * The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):
   *
   *  *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
   *  *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
   *  *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
   *  *  `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
   *  *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
   *  *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
   *  *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
   *  *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
   *  *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
   *  *  `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used).
   *  *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
   *
   * #### Built-in permissions ####
   *
   * The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.

   *
   * ### About project roles ###
   *
   * [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).
   *
   * Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.
   *
   * #### Members and actors ####
   *
   * In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.
   *
   * Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:
   *
   *  *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
   *  *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

   *
   * ##### Always false condition #####
   *
   * A condition that always fails.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "AlwaysFalseCondition"
   *      }
   *
   * ##### Block transition until approval #####
   *
   * A condition that blocks issue transition if there is a pending approval.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "BlockInProgressApprovalCondition"
   *      }
   *
   * ##### Compare number custom field condition #####
   *
   * A condition that allows transition if a comparison between a number custom field and a value is true.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "CompareNumberCFCondition",
   *        "configuration": {

   *          "fieldValue": 2
   *        }
   *      }
   *
   *  *  `comparator` One of the supported comparator: `=`, `>`, and `<`.
   *  *  `fieldId` The custom numeric field ID. Allowed field types:
   *
   *      *  `com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:float`
   *      *  `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:jsw-story-points`
   *  *  `fieldValue` The value for comparison.
   *
   * ##### Hide from user condition #####
   *
   * A condition that hides a transition from users. The transition can only be triggered from a workflow function or REST API operation.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "RemoteOnlyCondition"
   *      }
   *

   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "AllowOnlyReporter"
   *      }
   *
   * ##### Permission condition #####
   *
   * A condition that allows only users with a permission to execute a transition.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "PermissionCondition",
   *        "configuration": {
   *            "permissionKey": "BROWSE_PROJECTS"
   *        }
   *      }
   *
   *  *  `permissionKey` The permission required to perform the transition. Allowed values: [built-in](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions) or app defined permissions.
   *
   * ##### Previous status condition #####
   *
   * A condition that allows a transition based on whether an issue has or has not transitioned through a status.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "PreviousStatusCondition",
   *        "configuration": {

   *          }
   *        }
   *      }
   *
   * By default this condition allows the transition if the status, as defined by its ID in the `previousStatus` object, matches any previous issue status, unless:
   *
   *  *  `ignoreLoopTransitions` is `true`, then loop transitions (from and to the same status) are ignored.
   *  *  `includeCurrentStatus` is `true`, then the current issue status is also checked.
   *  *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` is `true`, then only the issue's preceding status (the one immediately before the current status) is checked.
   *  *  `reverseCondition` is `true`, then the status must not be present.
   *
   * ##### Separation of duties condition #####
   *
   * A condition that prevents a user to perform the transition, if the user has already performed a transition on the issue.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "SeparationOfDutiesCondition",
   *        "configuration": {

   *          }
   *        }
   *      }
   *
   *  *  `fromStatus` OPTIONAL. An object containing the ID of the source status of the transition that is blocked. If omitted any transition to `toStatus` is blocked.
   *  *  `toStatus` An object containing the ID of the target status of the transition that is blocked.
   *
   * ##### Subtask blocking condition #####
   *
   * A condition that blocks transition on a parent issue if any of its subtasks are in any of one or more statuses.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "SubTaskBlockingCondition",
   *        "configuration": {
   *          "statuses": [

   *  *  `statuses` A list of objects containing status IDs.
   *
   * ##### User is in any group condition #####
   *
   * A condition that allows users belonging to any group from a list of groups to execute a transition.
   *
   *     {
   *        "type": "UserInAnyGroupCondition",
   *        "configuration": {
   *          "groups": [
